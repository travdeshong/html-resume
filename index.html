        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a 27-year-old Brooklyn native who loves words, ideas, and stories. So far in my career, I've explored a variety of spaces including politics, journalism, marketing, and brand design. 
            Now I've begun to nurture an interest in web development. Language is what I live and breathe, and in a way the practice of programming can be seen as a commitment to deeply learning the rules
            and patterns of new technical languages. Furthermore, I desire to build experiences for others, interactive things that affect them intellectually and aesthetically. I see that desire come through 
            in other areas of my life, from my fiction writing to my film criticism to my past in acting. I'm so excited to see where this web development journey takes me.</p>
